# GAN-for-Fashion
 AI can help us to not only predict the category of a clothing item, but also to create computer-generated images of similar-looking items.
This can be pretty handy for retailers and fashion designers who strive to create personalized clothes or predict broader fashion trends.
So in this project we will use GAN to generate new designs of clothes .
I collected new data for this project with fashionable clothes in 2022 , you can find it here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeerelmorshedy/fashion-clothes
